# Business Applications

Use WorkIQ entity tools with paths under `/businessapps/` for business-application environments, data, apps,
skills, APIs, and operations. This path space is distinct from Microsoft Graph application registrations. Do not
substitute a separate endpoint, another MCP server, or an invented REST URL.

## Discovery and path grounding

1. Start intent-driven discovery with one focused `search_paths` call and a natural-language description of the
   business record, workflow, app, or operation. Use only fields accepted by the connected WorkIQ tool schema.
   Treat discovery as grounded only when the response contains a `/businessapps/...` path. This searches indexed
   metadata such as skills, tables, apps, APIs, and operations, not business-record contents.
2. Use `fetch` on `/businessapps/environments/` when the user explicitly asks to list environments or identify the
   default environment. Do not guess an environment ID.
3. If `search_paths` errors or returns no `/businessapps/...` path, do not repeat or broaden the search. Use the
   environment inventory, select only the exact requested environment, and inspect only the relevant returned
   `apps`, `skills`, or `tables` collection. If the environment or capability is absent, abstain.
4. Discovery is read-only: use `search_paths`, not `do_action`. `do_action` is a POST action and may be denied based
   on the calling client's trust classification and the tenant's effective mutation policy. Returned paths can be
   passed directly to `fetch`, `get_schema`, or a write tool.
5. For an unknown path or identifier, discover the Business Applications resource this way — apps, tables, records,
   skills, APIs, and operations. Take each identifier from the returned paths. Do not guess an ID or name. Known
   structural inventory is the exception: use its direct `fetch` path, especially `/businessapps/environments/`.
   When a procedure-oriented request returns a matching `/skills/` path, fetch the best-matching skill before
   querying records or invoking operations. The skill provides procedure guidance; it does not read data or
   execute an action.
6. Use `get_schema` on the returned concrete path before an unfamiliar mutation or operation. Never fill in
   `{environmentId}`, `{tableName}`, `{recordId}`, `{appName}`, `{apiName}`, `{skillName}`, or operation names
   from memory.

Construct the one discovery query from the business domain, requested workflow
or judgment, and expected decision, evidence distinction, or output. Do not
reduce it to record names, product names, table nouns, or backend schema terms.
`search_paths` ranks lexical overlap with indexed metadata text; it cannot
recover workflow or output intent omitted from the query. More words are not
automatically better: preserve a small set of discriminating terms from the
user's request, and do not invent domain terminology or a skill name.

For a request to review whether an item is ready to advance and separate
satisfied, missing, and unknown criteria, prefer
`readiness review advance satisfied missing unknown criteria` over
`record process stage fields`. The first query preserves the requested workflow
and output; the second keeps only generic schema concepts. For a request to
prepare follow-up with decisions, commitments, open questions, and next actions,
keep those terms rather than searching only for the record or table name.

Do not use `do_action` on `/businessapps/me` for discovery even if that route is
exposed; use `search_paths` instead. The old route is POST-shaped and can be
policy-denied before any grounded path is returned, ending the workflow before
`search_paths` or `fetch` can run.

## Exact path and tool selection

| Intent | WorkIQ tool and Business Applications path |
|---|---|
| List environments/default | `fetch` `/businessapps/environments/` |
| List or describe tables | `fetch` or `get_schema` `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/tables[/<tableName>]` |
| Read a record | `fetch` `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/tables/{tableName}/records/{recordId}` |
| Query environment data | `do_action` `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/query` with `jsonBody: {"querytext":"SELECT ..."}` |
| Create a table | `create_entity` on `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/tables` with `{tableName, columns, displayName?, description?}` |
| Create a record | `create_entity` on `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/tables/{tableName}/records` with `{"item":{...}}` |
| Update a record | `update_entity` on `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/tables/{tableName}/records/{recordId}` with changed fields |
| Delete a record/table | `delete_entity` on the exact record or table path returned by discovery |
| List or inspect apps | `fetch` `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/apps[/<appName>]` |
| List or read a business skill | `fetch` `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/skills[/{skillName}]` |
| Create a business skill | `create_entity` on `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/skills` with the schema-defined skill payload |
| Update a business skill | `update_entity` on `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/skills/{skillName}` with changed fields |
| Delete a business skill | `delete_entity` on `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/skills/{skillName}` |
| Run an app-scoped operation | `do_action` on the exact `.../apps/{appName}/.../operations/{operationName}` path returned by `get_schema` |
| Invoke a Custom API | `do_action` on the exact `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/customapis/{apiName}` path returned by discovery, with API inputs in `jsonBody` |
| Delegate an open-ended goal to an environment | `do_action` `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/execute-work` with `{"instruction":"...","sessionId":"<optional>"}` |
| Invoke an in-app MCP tool | `do_action` on the exact `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/mcp/{serverName}/tools/{toolName}` path |

Environment SQL queries and Custom APIs with input bodies are actions, not functions. Use `do_action` with the
schema-defined `jsonBody`. Use `call_function` only for an exact function path returned by discovery; do not use it
for `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/query`.

## Business skills

Business skills are reusable, environment-scoped capabilities that a business application exposes, and they are
addressed like any other Business Applications resource. They are **not** the same thing as this WorkIQ skill or
its `references/*.md` files.

- Read one skill with `fetch` on `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/skills/{skillName}`, or list the
  collection with `fetch` on `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/skills`.
- Skills are writable with the same entity tools used for records: `create_entity` on the `skills` collection,
  and `update_entity` or `delete_entity` on the concrete `skills/{skillName}` path.
- Call `get_schema` on the skill or collection path before a create or update, and send only schema-confirmed
  fields. Do not infer a skill's payload shape from a record or table payload.
- Resolve `{skillName}` from `search_paths` and preserve the exact returned casing. Do not invent skill names.

## Approval and privilege boundaries

Business Applications writes execute immediately. Apply the general WorkIQ
write-confirmation rule before calling `create_entity`, `update_entity`,
`delete_entity`, or a mutating `do_action`.

WorkIQ may deny mutations and POST actions based on the calling client's trust classification and the tenant's
effective policy. This does not block read-only discovery with `search_paths` or structural reads with `fetch`. If a
genuine write or action is policy-denied, stop and report the observed diagnostic. Surface only its stated
remediation; do not assert that a particular setting, consent, or administrator action will fix it unless the
diagnostic says so, and do not retry through another path.

- If the user explicitly says a preview or deletion is **not approved**, use
  discovery and reads only. Do not call the write tool merely to let the
  server reject it, and do not treat a rejection as a substitute for user
  confirmation.
- When prior transcript context records an explicit approval, perform only the
  approved mutation, once, through the schema-defined path.
- A named but unavailable environment is a hard stop. Never redirect the request
  to a default, similarly named, or otherwise available environment.
- An approved create or update is complete only when the current turn contains
  the matching write receipt and, when supported, a read-back of that exact
  target. A pre-existing lookalike is not proof of completion.
- If the approved operation fails for a missing privilege, authorization, or
  policy, **stop the mutation workflow immediately** and report that exact
  failure. Do not continue searching for another write route. Do not modify a
  different table, record, view, saved query, skill, or app artifact as a
  workaround and do not claim the requested operation succeeded.
- Schema and customization requests must use the discovered schema-mutation
  operation. Record-level access does not imply customization rights, and a
  saved view or ordinary record update is not a schema-customization fallback.

## When to use `execute-work`

Use `execute-work` when the user wants to **delegate an open-ended goal** to the business agent in a specific
environment and completing that goal requires the environment to plan or coordinate multiple steps, choose among
its skills or operations, or maintain a delegated work session. Discover the environment and confirm that its
returned paths expose `execute-work`, then pass the user's complete goal in `instruction`.

Prefer direct tools when WorkIQ already exposes the precise operation:

- Use `fetch`, `get_schema`, or `search_paths` for discovery, metadata, and exact reads.
- Use `create_entity`, `update_entity`, or `delete_entity` for a known data mutation.
- Use `do_action` for a discovered environment SQL query; use `call_function`
  only for a discovered function path.
- Use `do_action` on a discovered app-scoped operation or Custom API when that operation directly satisfies the
  request.

Choose `execute-work` when the requested outcome is best expressed as a delegated goal rather than a specific
WorkIQ operation. For a continuation, pass the prior `sessionId`; otherwise omit it. Treat the returned work result
as evidence from the environment, and surface any ambiguity, partial completion, requested confirmation, or failure
rather than claiming success.

`execute-work` is not a fallback for a missing named skill, app operation, or
Custom API. When the user asks to run a specific named capability:

1. discover the environment's available skills and operations;
2. fetch the candidate definition when one is returned;
3. require an exact capability match before invoking it;
4. if it does not exist, state that clearly and abstain from execution.

Do not silently substitute a similar skill, combine nearby records into an
invented result, or reinterpret a different workflow as the requested
capability. You may offer discovered alternatives, but run one only after the
user chooses it.

## App-scoped operations

App-scoped paths intentionally differ from environment table paths:

- Environment record collection:
  `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/tables/{tableName}/records`
- App table:
  `/businessapps/environments/{environmentId}/apps/{appName}/tables/{tableName}`
- App operations are directly under the app table or record path and **omit `/records/`**. Use only operation names
  returned by `get_schema`, such as `view`, `read`, `prepare_create`, `submit_create`, `prepare_update`,
  `submit_update`, `prepare_delete`, or `submit_delete`.
- Use `view` for bounded/form-aware app record browsing. Use `prepare_*` then `submit_*` when the schema exposes
  that two-step operation.

## Grounding rules

- WorkIQ's top-level `ask` can also answer questions about Business Applications requests, though some applications
  may not be included in `ask`, so use `search_paths` for authoritative semantic path discovery.
- Do not invent `/businessapps` REST shapes, append OData syntax to an undiscovered Business Applications path, or
  move `/records/` into an app-scoped path.
- Preserve exact casing and IDs returned by tools in subsequent calls, although structural path segments are
  case-insensitive.
- A write is complete only when the tool response confirms it. For a multi-turn delegated workflow, preserve and
  reuse the returned/provided `sessionId`; drafting and sending are separate turns when the workflow requires
  confirmation.
- For metadata-only questions with an unknown path, use `search_paths`, then fetch the returned resource. For known
  structural inventory, use its direct `fetch` path instead, especially `/businessapps/environments/` for environment
  listing. For exact data reads/writes, use the environment/table/app paths directly after discovery.
